# PSRNet
This project uses Neural Networks/ML/AI computervision techniques to identify different species of plants in specific plots in Antarctica. The work is done in conjuction with and as a part of a project with Dr. Natasja Van-Gestel from Texas Tech University as part of the Clark Scholar's program.

I will add instructions on how to use when the project is closer to completion
